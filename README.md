# Project: A Simple Q&A Search Engine in the Context of Coronavirus Pandemic

## Team: Evolution

## Abstract: 
This work presents a simple search engine implementation that retrieves data from pandemic-related questions based on Tf-idf scores and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm classification.

The application returns information from several input questions about the pandemic, showing the most relevant answer calculated by the system and also suggests a related scientific article for reading. 

The datasets used in this approach were obtained from websites of Brazilian Ministry of Health, Fiocruz Foundation, Laura PA Digital and CORD-19.
